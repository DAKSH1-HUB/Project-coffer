Methodology

Data collection(web scraping) ---> Data Pre-processing(removing stop words,punctuations..) ---> Sentiment Analysis(finding positive score,negative score, polarity index, fog index..)

Description

In this project I have used web scarping for collecting text data from multiple websites of same domain and performed sentiment analysis. I completed
this project as a case study given from a company Black coffer. 

Input file contains the websites I have scraped the text data from.
There are different stop_word files which contains different types of stop words.
There are pre defined positive and negative words which i have used to identify positive and negative words in text data.

At the end, I performed sentiment analysis such as positive score, negative score, polarity score, Avg sentence length, Fog_index and many more.
