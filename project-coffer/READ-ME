Instructions:

In this project I have used web scarping for collecting text data from multiple websites and performed sentiment analysis. I completed
this project as a case study given from a company Black coffer. 

Input file contains the websites I have scraped the text data from.
There are different stop_word files which contains different types of stop words.
There are pre defined positive and negative words which i have used to identify positive and negative words in text data.

At the end, I have found different scores such as positive score, negative score, polarity score, Avg sentence length, Fog_index and many more.

Thank you
